I just uploaded this files, in the meantime I am boarding on my flight to Singapore.
Not sure you can even run everything. I noticed that the dataSelectionAndLoading script is 
using the mapVBVD package. therefore you will need to add the path of /code/MATLAB/ReadRawDataSiemens
to the matlab search path. (probably). Did my best in the limited amount of time.
